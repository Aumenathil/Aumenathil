This is meant for sharing and educational purposes. 


I've tried to make this entire page public so that anyone can access it. I believe knowledge is to be shared, and although I've spent
much much money on my own education up to Information Technology, I do not necessarily believe that knowledge should be guarded
or kept away from those that seek to know. I majored in Philosophy because I have a curious mind, and continue to ask why and how. 

So, hopefully something on this page will help someone who might want to know how to do something on the computer a little faster, or a little more secure.
